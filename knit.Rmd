## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r , echo=FALSE}

library(rgdal)
library(leaflet)

states <- readOGR("C:/Users/Thib/Documents/GIS DataBase/Entidad Federativa/dest_2015gw/dest_2015gw.shp",
                                    layer = "dest_2015gw", GDAL1_integer64_policy = TRUE)

m <- leaflet(states) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 0.5,
                            opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0.5,
                            fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", AREA)(AREA),
                            highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = "white", weight = 2,
                                     bringToFront = TRUE),  label = ~as.character(states$AREA))

m


 

```

## Including Plots

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
